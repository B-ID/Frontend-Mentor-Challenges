## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

During this project, I learnt about poisitioning, sizing, and overlaying background images with a background color. I've gotten better in implementing responsive styles using mixins, I highly recommend it. Please check the sass files to see how I've implemented them. I had issues setting the view port height to match up with the design so I used a different viewport height for mobile and desktop screen sizes. 



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on creating more dynamic websites using javascript methods like adding event listeners and also animations to support smooth transitions of HTML elements.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](csstricks.com) - This helped me in setting background properties and positioning flex-items within a flex parent. Most times I find it more helpful than stackoverflow
